    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement:</h2>
    <p>The term "Progressive Enhancement" is supposed to represent the blueprint for approaching web developement. There's an analogy that the author of this article uses that I personally think describes the method very well; he wants you to think of it as a Peanut M&M. As silly as it sounds, it makes a lot of sense once you start thinking about it. The content of the M&M is the (X)HTML, the choclate coating on the outside of the HTML is the CSS, and the final bit, the shell, is client side scripting.</p>
    <p>I love the way this class took this style and taught with it. We started off the semster learning HTML, the bare-bone basics of a website, and then we went into CSS which made it look more presentable. After a few months of CSS, we got to experience a little bit of the client side scripting with Javascript. The path the class took directly correlates to the concepts in the article. This method made learning the courses content much more digestable for a newcomer like myself.</p>
    <h2>Final Project Reflection</h2>
    <p>This classes final project was a very challenging and creative assignment. The project was to develope and design a mini-webpage with the skills we have learned throughout the semester. I will admit, it was a very daunting task at first glance. However, once I really got into the building of the web-page, I ended up with a very encaging and rewarding experience.</p>
    <p>That being said, I made a lot of mistakes. Most of them, however, I was able to fix. My first mistep was how early I validated and copied my HTML. This caused me to alter and change certain parts of the HTML throughout the entire project when I could've just had it all done in one fell swoop. Definetily a learning experience there. Another issue I came across was whyen I showed my dad my project. His feedback was slim, but one of the main things he mentioned was the header and footer did not span the entire width of the webpage. It took me a while to fix this but I eventually set both the footer and header's padding to 0 and then set both of their width to 100. This solution work very well. </p>
    <p> Overall, I'm very proud of the webpage I built. I belive the design is fairly simplistic but it gets the job done. I wanted to simulate the blackness of space with the hints of orange to represent mars, so I made the background black and made headings a dark orange. I love how it turned out. </p>
