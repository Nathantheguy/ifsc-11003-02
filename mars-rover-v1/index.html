    <h1>Exploring Mars: The Rovers That Changed Our Understanding of the Red Planet</h1>
</header>
<main>
<section id="Beginning">
    <p>For decades, NASA’s Mars rover missions have pushed the boundaries of science, technology, and human curiosity. These robotic explorers have driven across alien landscapes, searched for signs of ancient life, and paved the way for future human missions to Mars.</p>

    <p>This site highlights two of the most groundbreaking missions — <strong>Curiosity</strong> and <strong>Perseverance</strong> — exploring their goals, discoveries, and technical innovations.</p>

<section id="Overview">
    <h2>Mission Overview</h2>

    <p>Launched as part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, Curiosity landed on Mars in <strong>August 2012</strong>. Its primary goal is to determine whether Mars ever had environmental conditions capable of supporting microbial life.</p>

    <h2>Launch and Landing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch Date: November 26, 2011</li>
        <li>Launch Vehicle: Atlas V 541 rocket</li>
        <li>Landing Site: Gale Crater, August 6, 2012
        Curiosity’s landing used a groundbreaking “sky crane” system that lowered the rover gently onto the Martian surface — a first in planetary exploration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Major discoveries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Detected ancient streambeds, indicating that liquid water once flowed on Mars.</li>
        <li>Discovered organic molecules preserved in Martian rocks, a potential indicator of past life-friendly conditions.</li>
        <li>Measured fluctuating methane levels in the atmosphere, a possible sign of biological or geological activity.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Technical and Design Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Size: About the size of a small SUV (3 meters long, 900 kg).</li>
        <li>Power Source: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), providing long-term energy.</li>
        <li>Scientific Tools: Includes the ChemCam laser spectrometer, SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars), and MAHLI camera for close-up imaging. Curiosity’s design balances rugged mobility with advanced laboratory instruments, enabling it to climb slopes and analyze rock samples autonomously.</li>
    </ul>
