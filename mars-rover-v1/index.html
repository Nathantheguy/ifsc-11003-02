<section id="Beginning">
    <p>For decades, NASA’s Mars rover missions have pushed the boundaries of science, technology, and human curiosity. These robotic explorers have driven across alien landscapes, searched for signs of ancient life, and paved the way for future human missions to Mars.</p>

    <p>This site highlights two of the most groundbreaking missions — <strong>Curiosity</strong> and <strong>Perseverance</strong> — exploring their goals, discoveries, and technical innovations.</p>

<section id="Curiosity">
    
    <h2>Curiosity Rover</h2>
    <h3>Mission Overview</h3>
    <p>Launched as part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, Curiosity landed on Mars in <strong>August 2012</strong>. Its primary goal is to determine whether Mars ever had environmental conditions capable of supporting microbial life.</p>


    <h3>Launch and Landing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch Date: November 26, 2011</li>
        <li>Launch Vehicle: Atlas V 541 rocket</li>
        <li>Landing Site: Gale Crater, August 6, 2012
        Curiosity’s landing used a groundbreaking “sky crane” system that lowered the rover gently onto the Martian surface — a first in planetary exploration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major discoveries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Detected ancient streambeds, indicating that liquid water once flowed on Mars.</li>
        <li>Discovered organic molecules preserved in Martian rocks, a potential indicator of past life-friendly conditions.</li>
        <li>Measured fluctuating methane levels in the atmosphere, a possible sign of biological or geological activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical and Design Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Size: About the size of a small SUV (3 meters long, 900 kg).</li>
        <li>Power Source: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), providing long-term energy.</li>
        <li>Scientific Tools: Includes the ChemCam laser spectrometer, SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars), and MAHLI camera for close-up imaging. Curiosity’s design balances rugged mobility with advanced laboratory instruments, enabling it to climb slopes and analyze rock samples autonomously.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="Perseverance">
    <h2>Perseverance Rover</h2>

    <p>NASA’s Mars 2020 mission launched Perseverance to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect samples that could one day return to Earth. Perseverance is also testing new technologies critical for future human exploration.</p>

<h3>Launch and Landing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Launch Date: July 30, 2020</li>
        <li>Launch Vehicle: Atlas V-541 rocket</li>
        <li>Landing Site: Jezero Crater, February 18, 2021</li>
        <li>Perseverance used an upgraded version of Curiosity’s sky crane system and carried a small helicopter, Ingenuity, which became the first powered aircraft to fly on another planet.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Major Discoveries and Accomplishments</h3>        
    <ul>
        <li>Collected and sealed the first samples of Martian rock and soil for potential return to Earth.</li>
        <li>Confirmed that Jezero Crater once contained a delta system, supporting the theory that it hosted a lake billions of years ago.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere using the MOXIE experiment.</li>
        <li>Enabled over 70 successful flights of Ingenuity, exceeding all mission expectations</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Technical and Design Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Size: Similar to Curiosity, but more advanced (about 1,025 kg).</li>
        <li>Power Source: RTG, providing reliable energy for years.</li>
        <li>Instruments: Equipped with SHERLOC, PIXL, SuperCam, and a drill system for core sampling.</li>
        <li>Cameras and AI Navigation: Features 23 cameras and advanced onboard computing for autonomous driving and hazard avoidance.</li>
    </ul>
