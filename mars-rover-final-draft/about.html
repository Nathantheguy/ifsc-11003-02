    <h2>About Us</h2>
<p id="aboutnasa">At NASA Rovers, we are driven by a single, powerful mission: to explore worlds beyond our own and push the boundaries of human discovery. For more than two decades, NASA’s family of robotic explorers has traveled across the rugged terrain of Mars and beyond, transforming how we understand our solar system and our place within it.</p>
<p id="aboutnasa">Our rovers are more than machines—they are ambassadors of curiosity, designed to go where humans cannot yet travel. From analyzing ancient Martian rocks to searching for signs of past life, each rover carries cutting-edge science tools, advanced AI systems, and the hopes of countless engineers, scientists, and explorers.</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We create highly resilient robotic explorers capable of surviving extreme temperatures, treacherous landscapes, and the long journey through space.</li>
    <li>Our missions uncover the secrets of planetary environments—studying geology, climate, atmosphere, and the potential for life on other worlds.</li>
    <li>Every rover introduces new technologies that pave the way for future human missions, from autonomous navigation to groundbreaking scientific instruments.</li>
    <li>We aim to ignite curiosity in the next generation of explorers by sharing the science, challenges, and triumphs of robotic space exploration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Legacy of Exploration</h3>
<p>From the pioneering Pathfinder and Sojourner to Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, NASA’s rovers have reshaped our understanding of Mars. Each mission builds on the last, painting a clearer picture of the planet’s history and its potential to sustain life.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>The future of exploration is bright. New rovers, landers, and aerial scouts are in development, each designed to unlock new frontiers—from Mars samples returning to Earth, to robotic missions venturing to icy moons and distant asteroids.</p>
<p>At NASA Rovers, we believe exploration is a journey that belongs to everyone.
Together, we continue to reach farther, learn more, and imagine what’s possible.</p>
