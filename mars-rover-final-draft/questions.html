<section id="faq">
<h1 id="rover-type">Curiosity:</h1>
<h2>What is the Curiosity rover and when did it land on Mars?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity is a car-sized robotic rover designed to explore Gale Crater on Mars. It landed on August 6, 2012, as part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission.</p>
<h2>What is the main mission of the Curiosity rover?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity’s primary mission is to determine whether Mars ever had environmental conditions suitable for microbial life. It studies the planet’s climate, geology, and the role of water in shaping its surface.</p>
<h2>How does Curiosity study the rocks and soil on Mars?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity uses a suite of instruments—including lasers, cameras, spectrometers, and a sample-analysis lab—to drill into rocks, scoop up soil, and analyze their chemical and mineral composition.</p>
<h2>How does Curiosity navigate across the Martian surface?</h2>
    <p>The rover relies on onboard hazard-avoidance cameras, stereo imaging, and autonomous navigation software that helps it plan safe driving routes across rough terrain.</p>
<h2>What has Curiosity discovered about past water on Mars?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity has found strong evidence that Gale Crater once hosted long-lasting lakes and streams. It has detected clays, sediments, and chemical signatures that indicate Mars had habitable conditions billions of years ago.</p>
<h2>How is the Curiosity rover powered?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity uses a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts heat from the natural decay of plutonium-238 into electricity.</p>
<h2>How long was Curiosity originally supposed to operate on Mars?</h2>
    <p>Curiosity was designed for a two-Earth-year mission, but it has exceeded that by many years and continues to operate and send back science data.</p>

<h1 id="rover-type">Perseverance:</h1>
<h2>What is the purpose of the Perseverance rover mission?</h2>
    <p>Perseverance’s mission focuses on searching for signs of ancient microbial life, studying Mars’ geology, collecting rock cores for future return to Earth, and testing new technologies for future human exploration.</p>
<h2>When did Perseverance arrive on Mars, and where did it land?</h2>
    <p>Perseverance landed on February 18, 2021, inside Jezero Crater—an ancient lakebed believed to be one of the most promising places to look for past life.</p>
<h2>What scientific instruments does Perseverance carry?</h2>
    <p>The rover carries a suite of advanced instruments, including ground-penetrating radar, high-resolution cameras, spectrometers, environmental sensors, and systems designed to detect organic compounds and past biosignatures.</p>
<h2>How does Perseverance search for signs of ancient life?</h2>
    <p>It studies layered rock formations, examines chemical compositions, uses ultraviolet and X-ray tools to scan for organics, and takes samples from sites most likely to preserve ancient microbes.</p>
<h2>What is the Mars Sample Return campaign, and how does Perseverance support it?</h2>
    <p>Perseverance drills and caches rock and soil cores in sealed tubes. A future mission—part of a multi-agency campaign—aims to retrieve those samples and return them to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.</p>
<h2>What is the role of the Ingenuity helicopter?</h2>
    <p>Ingenuity is a small technology-demonstration helicopter that became the first aircraft to achieve powered flight on another planet. It helps scout terrain and test flight operations in Mars’ thin atmosphere.</p>
<h2>How does Perseverance communicate with Earth?</h2>
    <p>The rover communicates through NASA’s Deep Space Network using relays via Mars-orbiting spacecraft, which transmit data and commands between Earth and the rover more efficiently than direct communication alone.</p>
